        I grew up in Bremen, Germany, in a family of book-crazy women. My career in advertising brought me to New York City in my early twenties. After working for several large ad agencies in the city, I left the rat race to be home with my three spirited (read: loud and strong-willed) children. Being a full-time mom is the best job in the world. It’s also the hardest and not always the most fulfilling. Then a magical thing happened: I discovered my love for writing. And over the course of a couple of life-changing years, I wrote my first novel, <a href = "" style = "color: rgb(255, 83, 83);font-family: Arial Narrow, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 1.3px; line-height: 1.3; font-size: 17px;">Boloo</a><br><br>

        I can’t believe I get to share it with you now! Only Child has been published by Knopf here in the U.S. and by Mantle in the U.K.. It will also be published in many <a href = "" style = "color: rgb(255, 83, 83);font-family: Arial Narrow, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 1.3px; line-height: 1.3; font-size: 17px;">countries</a> around the world and translated into sixteen other languages. I can’t wait for you to read it.<br><br>

        I made this website for you, dear reader. I invite you to become involved.<br><br>

        Would you like to invite me to talk about Only Child at your next book club or library event? I'm available for events in the NYC area or via Skype or FaceTime. <a href = "" style = "color: rgb(255, 83, 83);font-family: Arial Narrow, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 1.3px; line-height: 1.3; font-size: 17px;">Contact me here.</a><br><br>

        Please check out my upcoming events, I would love to see you there.<br><br>
